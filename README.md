# Facial_expression_recognition_Using_CNN
I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow, leveraging the FER-2013 dataset, accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013). Achieving an impressive accuracy of 86%, the model excels in facial emotion recognition. By seamlessly integrating OpenCV 2, it seamlessly interfaces with the webcam, enabling real-time emotion detection. This sophisticated fusion of cutting-edge technology showcases its prowess in capturing and interpreting human expressions with remarkable precision.
