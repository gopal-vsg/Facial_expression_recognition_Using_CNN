# Facial_expression_recognition_Using_CNN
The CNN is tailored for facial expression recognition, featuring three convolutional layers for extracting facial features. Batch normalization and max pooling enhance stability and spatial reduction. Dense layers process flattened features, culminating in a softmax output layer for multi-class facial expression classification.
